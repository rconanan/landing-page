This is my first go at creating a Landing page for myself by using the lessons from the Odin Project! Here I go!

Finished my Final Draft on 1/10/2023

Still need to work on adding certain Flex Properties.

All is used is HTML, CSS and Flexbox!

Images are from Unsplash and loremfaces.

Update: Change name of Landing Page project.
